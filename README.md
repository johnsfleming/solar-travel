# solar-travel

A simple calculator.  

Put in your birthday, and it spits out how many miles/kms you have traveled around the sun (updating every second).

Also tells you when to celebrate 1 billion, 25 billion, and 50 billion miles/kms traveled.

Based off of a rough estimate of the Earth's speed orbiting the sun (used 30 km/sec and 60,000 mph)
